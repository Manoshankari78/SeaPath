# SeaPath — AI-Assisted Ship Route & Fuel Optimization Platform

A full-stack ship-routing project: a **FastAPI + Python** backend that computes
fuel-, safety-, and speed-optimized sea routes with a real A\* search over a
navigable ocean grid, and a **React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS** frontend
with an interactive Leaflet map, a risk-radar heatmap, fleet dashboard, and
voyage history/reporting — all behind JWT authentication.

## How routing works

1. A rectangular lat/lon **grid** is built around the origin/destination (with
   the search box widened automatically if a landmass blocks the direct
   corridor — e.g. routing around a subcontinent).
2. Each grid cell is classified **ocean or land** using the offline
   `global-land-mask` package (no external data download required).
3. **A\*** search runs three times per request with different edge-cost
   weightings — `fastest`, `efficient` (fuel-optimal), and `safest`
   (wave/wind-risk averse) — each returning a distinct route.
4. Live **wave/wind data** is sampled (concurrently) from the free Open-Meteo
   Marine API across the search area and factored into the cost function,
   the route's overall risk score, and a **per-point risk array** used by the
   frontend's risk-radar heatmap.
5. A small **RandomForest ML model** (trained on synthetic, physically
   plausible data at startup) refines the physics-based fuel estimate.
6. Results include distance, duration, fuel burn, CO₂ emissions, a risk
   score, and a 0–100 sustainability score.

## Feature set

- **Authentication** — JWT-based register/login; fleets and voyages are
  scoped to the signed-in user.
- **Fleet dashboard** — vessel profiles with type, cruise speed, draft,
  deadweight, and an optional custom fuel-burn rate.
- **Route planner** — three strategy options per request, a what-if speed
  simulator, and high-risk alert banners.
- **Risk-radar heatmap** — toggle an overlay that colors the route
  segment-by-segment (green/amber/red) by local wave/wind risk.
- **Voyage history** — status tracking (Planned → In-Progress → Completed),
  waypoints, and downloadable PDF reports.
- **Alerts** — automatic `StormWarning` alerts when a saved route crosses
  high-risk weather, and a **dynamic re-routing** endpoint that re-evaluates
  a saved voyage against live conditions and raises a `RouteChange` alert if
  the fuel/risk estimate has shifted materially. The alerts bell in the nav
  bar polls for updates.
- **Spatial search (PostGIS)** — `GET /api/voyages/nearby?lat=&lon=&radius_km=`
  finds saved voyages passing within a radius of a point using a real
  `ST_DWithin` geography query (falls back to a Python haversine calculation
  on SQLite).

### New in v1.1 — Indian ports & live tracking

- **Indian port search** — a seeded dataset of 45 Indian ports (all 12 Major
  Ports plus major non-major/private ports) with searchable, keyboard-accessible
  origin/destination dropdowns. Search by port name, state, or UN/LOCODE.
- **Live ship tracking** — the vessel's current position streams to the map
  over a WebSocket (with an automatic polling fallback), rendered as a
  heading-rotated ship marker.
- **AIS provider architecture** — positions are read through a pluggable
  `AISProvider` interface. Ships with `MockAISProvider` (the built-in voyage
  simulator) so the project is fully demonstrable without a paid AIS feed;
  a real feed is an environment-variable swap.
- **Demo ship simulation** — the vessel moves along the *actual A\*-calculated
  route*, interpolated between waypoints for smooth motion. Start / pause /
  reset with 1x–10x playback.
- **Voyage progress** — distance travelled, distance remaining, percentage and
  ETA, all derived from real route geometry.
- **Ship track history** — persisted breadcrumb positions drawn as a polyline,
  visually distinct from the remaining (dashed) route.
- **Live vessel weather & risk** — the existing Open-Meteo client and wave-risk
  model are re-used at the vessel's current position, raising `StormWarning`
  alerts through the existing alert system when conditions deteriorate.
- **Port map overlay** — toggle **Show Indian Ports** to plot every port; click
  one to set - **Conditions at current location** — a card that uses the browser's
  geolocation (on explicit click, not automatically) to show live wave,
  wind and sea-temperature conditions at wherever you're standing, reusing
  the same weather service as the origin/destination cards.
  
## Quick start (local, no Docker)

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # http://localhost:8000
```
Interactive API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
(Set a real `SECRET_KEY` env var before deploying — the default is dev-only.)

By default this uses **SQLite** (`backend/seapath.db`, created automatically)
— zero extra setup. To use **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** instead, see the next
section.

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:5173
```
The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to `http://localhost:8000`, so just
run both and open the frontend URL.

## Running with PostgreSQL + PostGIS

The app works with either SQLite (default, zero setup) or PostgreSQL +
PostGIS. Switching just requires setting `DATABASE_URL` — no code changes.
When PostGIS is active, the `/api/voyages/nearby` endpoint runs a real
`ST_DWithin` spatial query (great-circle distance, not flat-plane) to find
saved voyages passing near a point; if PostGIS isn't available (SQLite, or
a Postgres user without `CREATE EXTENSION` rights) it falls back to an
equivalent haversine calculation in Python automatically, so the endpoint
never breaks either way.

`app/db/session.py` also normalizes the connection string: a `postgres://`
URL (what Heroku/Render/Railway/Supabase hand you) is rewritten to
`postgresql+psycopg2://` automatically, so you can paste a cloud dashboard's
URL straight into `DATABASE_URL` without editing it.

### A. Local PostgreSQL

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-16-postgis-3 postgresql-contrib
sudo service postgresql start

# macOS
brew install postgresql@16 postgis
brew services start postgresql@16
```
Create the database and set a password:
```bash
sudo -u postgres createdb seapath
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"
```
Point the backend at it (copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env`, or
export directly) and run as normal:
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/seapath"
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
On startup the app runs `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis` and then
creates all tables — no manual migration step needed. (This exact flow —
auth, fleet, route optimize, voyage save, and the PostGIS `ST_DWithin`
nearby-search — was verified end-to-end against a real local Postgres 16 +
PostGIS 3.4 instance while building this project.)

### B. Local via Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
This starts a `postgis/postgis:16-3.4` container alongside the backend and
frontend, with `DATABASE_URL` already wired up to it — nothing to configure.
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend:  http://localhost:8000/docs
- Postgres+PostGIS: localhost:5432 (db/user/password: seapath/postgres/postgres)

### C. Cloud deployment

The only thing that changes between providers is the connection string and
whether PostGIS needs enabling manually. General shape:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="<connection string from your provider>"
export SECRET_KEY="<a long random value — do not use the dev default>"
export ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://your-frontend-domain.com"
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Managed Postgres with PostGIS built in (Supabase, Neon, Render, Railway,
Aiven, ElephantSQL, AWS RDS with the PostGIS parameter/extension enabled):**
- Copy the connection string from the provider's dashboard straight into
  `DATABASE_URL` — `postgres://` and `postgresql://` forms both work.
- If PostGIS is already enabled by the provider (Supabase and most modern
  managed Postgres offer a one-click toggle), the app detects it and the
  spatial search runs as real PostGIS `ST_DWithin` queries.
- If the app's database user can't run `CREATE EXTENSION` (common on
  managed platforms — verified in testing that this fails safely), you'll
  see a one-time warning in the logs on startup and nothing else changes:
  the app still starts, and `/api/voyages/nearby` automatically falls back
  to the Python haversine calculation instead of erroring.
- If you want true PostGIS spatial queries on such a provider, enable the
  extension yourself once via the provider's SQL console or dashboard
  toggle (e.g. Supabase → Database → Extensions → postgis), or run
  `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis;` as an admin/superuser role.

**AWS RDS specifically:** PostGIS must be listed in the DB parameter
group's supported extensions (RDS Postgres ships with it available) and
the connecting user needs `rds_superuser` (or equivalent) to run
`CREATE EXTENSION`. If using a least-privilege app user instead, enable the
extension once with an admin user before pointing the app at it.

**SSL:** most cloud Postgres providers require SSL. If you see an SSL
negotiation error, append `?sslmode=require` to `DATABASE_URL`, e.g.
`postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db?sslmode=require`.

**Frontend on a separate host from the backend:** set
`VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the deployed backend's `/api` URL at build time
(see `frontend/Dockerfile`'s `ARG VITE_API_BASE_URL`), and set the
backend's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the frontend's deployed URL so CORS allows
the requests through.

### Inspecting the database
```bash
# SQLite
sqlite3 backend/seapath.db
.tables

# PostgreSQL (local or cloud — psql accepts the same DATABASE_URL)
psql "$DATABASE_URL"
\dt
SELECT PostGIS_Version();   -- only works if the extension is enabled
```

## Live tracking configuration

All values have working defaults — the app runs with no `.env` at all. See
`backend/.env.example`.

```env
AIS_PROVIDER=mock              # mock | real
LOCATION_UPDATE_INTERVAL=5     # seconds between position pushes
ENABLE_LIVE_TRACKING=true      # master switch for all tracking endpoints
POSITION_PERSIST_INTERVAL_S=60 # min seconds between DB position writes
MAX_TRACK_POINTS=500           # cap on history returned per track request
LIVE_ALERT_WAVE_HEIGHT_M=4.0   # wave height that raises a StormWarning
```

### How live tracking works

```
AIS provider (MockAISProvider | RealAISProvider)
        |                 selected by AIS_PROVIDER
        v
Backend tracking service  (throttled persistence, weather + risk, alerts)
        |
        v
WebSocket  /ws/vessels/{id}/location     <-- preferred
   or polling  GET /api/vessels/{id}/location   <-- automatic fallback
        |
        v
Frontend  useVesselTracking hook -> Zustand store
        |
        v
Leaflet ship marker (rotated to heading) + track polyline
```

**Simulated positions are never presented as real AIS data.** Every position
carries `source` and `is_simulated`, and the UI renders a
`LIVE TRACKING — DEMO SIMULATION` badge whenever the mock provider is active.

### Switching to a real AIS feed

1. Set `AIS_PROVIDER=real`, `AIS_API_URL` and `AIS_API_KEY` in the environment
   (never commit these).
2. Implement `_parse_vessel()` in `backend/app/services/ais/real_provider.py`
   to normalise your vendor's payload into a `VesselFix`.
3. Add an `mmsi` (or `imo`) column to the `Vessel` model to map SeaPath vessel
   IDs onto AIS identifiers.

Nothing else changes — the API, WebSocket, store and map all consume the same
`VesselFix` shape. Until step 2 is done the real provider returns no positions
rather than silently falling back to simulated data.

### How port search works

```
backend/app/data/indian_ports.py   (dataset, extensible)
        |  seed_ports() upserts on every boot
        v
ports table  ->  GET /api/ports?search=&state=&port_type=
        |
        v
Frontend loads once, filters locally  ->  PortSearch dropdown
        |
        v
Selected port -> latitude / longitude -> existing A* routing engine
```

To add a port, append a record to `INDIAN_PORTS` and restart. The seed is an
idempotent upsert keyed on `id`, so no migration is needed.

## Using the app

1. **Register** an account (Operator role by default).
2. Go to **Fleet Dashboard** and add a vessel — voyages are linked to a
   vessel ID.
3. Go to **Route Planner** and search for an **Origin** and **Destination**
   port (type a name, a state, or a UN/LOCODE — e.g. "Chennai", "Kerala",
   "INBOM"). Pick the vessel you just added, then click **Calculate Route**.
   Three route options render on the map. Toggle **Risk radar overlay** to see
   wave/wind risk color-coded along the route, or **Show Indian Ports** to plot
   every port and set origin/destination straight from the map.
4. Click a comparison card to preview that route, or start the voyage to
   persist it and begin live tracking (this also raises a StormWarning alert if
   the route crosses high-risk weather).
5. Use the **live tracking panel** to Start / Pause / Reset the simulation and
   change playback speed. The ship marker moves along the calculated route,
   leaving a green track behind it; progress, ETA and current wave/wind risk
   update as it sails. **Track Ship** re-centres the map on the vessel.
6. In **Voyage History**, update a voyage's status, download its PDF report,
   or click **Re-optimize now** to simulate dynamic re-routing against
   current conditions.
7. Check the 🔔 bell in the nav bar for alerts.

## Testing

```bash
# Backend (71 tests: ports, simulation, tracking, auth scoping, WebSocket)
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pytest httpx
pytest -q

# Frontend (33 tests: port dropdown, tracking panel, store)
cd frontend
npm install
npm test
```

Tests use a throwaway SQLite database and the mock AIS provider, so no network
access or external services are required.

## Extending toward production

- The app already runs on **PostgreSQL + PostGIS** (see above) — for scale,
  add indexes on `waypoints(latitude, longitude)` or a proper `geography`
  column with a GiST index if the spatial search needs to cover a very large
  voyage history.
- Swap the synthetic ML training set in `services/fuel_model.py` for real
  historical voyage logs.
- Swap `global-land-mask` for GSHHG/Natural Earth polygons in PostGIS for
  higher-resolution coastlines.
- Run `/api/route/reoptimize/{voyage_id}` on a scheduler (APScheduler /
  Celery beat) instead of on-demand, for true continuous dynamic re-routing.
- Add refresh tokens / shorter-lived access tokens for stronger auth.
